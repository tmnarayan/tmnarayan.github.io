Thank you for traveling to join us for our wedding! Weâ€™ll be thrilled to welcome you to Cincinnati.

## Hotels

Our ceremony and reception will take place at the [Hotel Covington](https://goo.gl/maps/1QZaNprSPTn), located just across the river from downtown Cincinnati.

* We have a block of rooms reserved at the hotel. Please [click here](https://res.windsurfercrs.com/ibe/details.aspx?propertyid=14389&nights=1&checkin=10/11/2019&group=1019WNWED) to book with our group rate or call 859-905-6700 and ask to book with the Werner-Narayan wedding rate.

* If you prefer, we also have a block of rooms reserved at the nearby Courtyard Cincinnati Covington (5 minute drive or 15 minute walk from the venue). Please [click here](https://www.marriott.com/event-reservations/reservation-link.mi?id=1546965646034&key=GRP&app=resvlink) to book with our group rate or call 859-491-4000 and ask to book with the Werner-Narayan room block.

We recommend that you reserve your rooms as soon as possible. [BLINK](https://www.blinkcincinnati.com/about/), an interactive outdoor art installation, is taking place the same weekend and hotels project fairly high occupancy rates.

## Airports

* The Cincinnati (CVG) airport is a 20 minute drive from the hotel. An Uber should run ~$25-30. Downtown Covington is walkable, and downtown Cincinnati can be reached by Uber or [bike share](https://www.cincyredbike.org/). If you plan to venture farther afield, you may wish to rent a car.

* You may also wish to check flights to Dayton (DAY), which is 1 - 1.5 hours away (depending on traffic).
